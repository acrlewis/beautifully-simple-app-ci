- many people when setting up ci/cd jump straight into tools like jenkins, travis or circle

- the first thing to understand is what are we trying to do: generate artifacts from code
- these artifacts are going to need to be versioned

- the best first steps are to build the components of a pipeline first, as simple commands, then compose them later on
